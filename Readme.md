# 👩‍🏫Faculty Evaluation System


## 👇About Faculty Evaluation System
The Faculty Evaluation System is a PHP/MySQL project that helps an individual school manage its evaluation results. The system has three user types which are the Administrator, Faculties, and the Students.
<br>
The Administrator user is in-charge of maintaining and populate the data in the system database using the front-end feature for the admin sides, such as the list of subjects, faculties, students, and some other related data. The student users are permitted only to evaluate the faculties assigned to their class per issue. If the faculty teaches the class 2 subjects, the study will determine the teacher twice. The faculties users are only allowed to view their evaluation result even the evaluation is still ongoing.


## 🌟 Why Use This System

2. **User-friendly Interface:** The system provides an intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface for all user types, enhancing user experience and reducing the learning curve.
